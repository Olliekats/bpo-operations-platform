## Root Cause

This error occurs when the application cannot connect to the Supabase authentication service. The most common reasons are:

1. **Development server needs restart** (Most Common - 90% of cases)
   - Environment variables aren't loaded
   - Supabase client not properly initialized

2. **Network connectivity issues**
   - Firewall blocking connection
   - Internet connection problems
   - Supabase service temporarily unavailable

3. **Environment configuration**
   - `.env` file missing or corrupted
   - Invalid Supabase credentials

## Solution Steps

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Restart the Development Server (PRIMARY FIX)

**This fixes the issue 90% of the time!**

1. **Stop the current server:**
   - Find the terminal running the dev server
   - Press `Ctrl+C` to stop it

2. **Restart the server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Wait for complete startup:**
   - Look for "‚úÖ Supabase initialized successfully" in console
   - Server should be running on http://localhost:5173

4. **Try signing in again**

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Check Browser Console

**Open Developer Tools to see detailed diagnostics:**

1. **Open Developer Tools:**
   - Press `F12` (Windows/Linux)
   - Or `Cmd+Option+I` (Mac)

2. **Click the "Console" tab**

3. **Look for these messages:**

   **GOOD (Working):**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Supabase initialized successfully
   URL: https://0ec90b57d6e95fcbda19832f.supabase.co
   ```

   **BAD (Needs Fix):**
   ```
   ‚ùå Missing Supabase environment variables
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL: ‚úó missing
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: ‚úó missing
   üîß Quick Fix: Restart the development server
   ```

4. **If you see the BAD message:**
   - Go back to Step 1
   - Restart the dev server
   - Problem should be resolved

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Use Built-In Help Feature

**NEW: The sign-in form now has built-in troubleshooting!**

1. When you see "Failed to fetch" error
2. Look for a **"Help?"** link next to the error message
3. Click it to see troubleshooting steps directly in the UI
4. Follow the on-screen instructions

**What the Help Section Shows:**
- Development server restart instructions
- Environment variable checks
- Internet connection verification

### ‚úÖ Step 4: Verify Environment Variables

**Check that the `.env` file exists and is correct:**

1. **Location:** Project root directory (same level as `package.json`)

2. **Should contain:**
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://0ec90b57d6e95fcbda19832f.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJib2x0IiwicmVmIjoiMGVjOTBiNTdkNmU5NWZjYmRhMTk4MzJmIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTg4ODE1NzQsImV4cCI6MTc1ODg4MTU3NH0.9I8-U0x86Ak8t2DGaIk0HfvTSLsAyzdnz-Nw00mMkKw
   ```

3. **No extra spaces or characters:**
   - No blank lines at the start
   - No spaces around the `=` sign
   - No quotes around values

4. **If file is missing or corrupted:**
   - Create new `.env` file in project root
   - Copy the exact contents above
   - Save and restart dev server

   - Check for port conflicts
   - Verify server started successfully

### If Everything Fails:

1. **Stop all running processes:**
   ```bash
   # Kill any running node processes
   pkill -f "vite"
   ```

2. **Clean install:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Check Supabase Project:**
   - Verify project is active at dashboard.supabase.com

## Prevention Tips

### Avoid This Issue in the Future:

1. **Always Restart After .env Changes:**
   - Any time you modify `.env`
   - Stop server and restart
   - Don't just save the file

2. **Keep Dev Server Running:**
   - Don't stop/start frequently
   - Let it run while developing
   - Only restart when necessary

3. **Check Console on Load:**
   - Look for Supabase initialization message
   - Catch issues early
   - Fix before attempting sign-in

4. **Use Git to Track Changes:**
   - `.env` is gitignored (good!)
   - But keep a backup copy
   - Document any changes
