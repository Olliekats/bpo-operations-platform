## 5. GAP ANALYSIS

### ❌ Missing Advanced Features

While all core CRUD modules are implemented, the following advanced features could enhance the platform:

#### 1. **Visual BPMN Editor**
- Current: Basic form-based process creation
- Gap: Interactive drag-and-drop BPMN diagram builder
- Impact: Medium - Users can still document processes

#### 2. **Advanced Analytics Visualizations**
- Current: Report configuration
- Gap: Interactive charts, graphs, and data visualizations
- Impact: Medium - Data is accessible, just not visualized

#### 3. **File Upload & Document Management**
- Current: Text-based content only
- Gap: File attachments for SOPs, policies, evidence
- Impact: Medium - Users can link to external documents

#### 4. **Workflow Execution Engine**
- Current: Workflow definition storage
- Gap: Actual workflow execution and automation
- Impact: High - Workflows are documented but not executed

#### 5. **Real-time Collaboration**
- Current: Single-user editing
- Gap: Multi-user real-time editing, comments, mentions
- Impact: Low - Users can still collaborate asynchronously

#### 6. **Advanced Reporting**
- Current: Report configuration
- Gap: PDF exports, email scheduling, custom templates
- Impact: Medium - Reports can be viewed but not exported

#### 7. **Notification System**
- Current: None
- Gap: Email/in-app notifications for updates, deadlines, approvals
- Impact: Medium - Users must check manually

#### 8. **Approval Workflows**
- Current: Status fields only
- Gap: Multi-stage approval process with routing
- Impact: Medium - Manual approval tracking possible

#### 9. **Search & Filtering**
- Current: Basic list display
- Gap: Advanced search, filters, sorting across modules
- Impact: Medium - Users can browse all items

#### 10. **AI Document Processing**
- Current: Placeholder module
- Gap: Actual AI integration for document analysis
- Impact: High if required - Currently non-functional
